# Landing Page Module

This Foundry VTT module displays a landing page with multiple pages. Each user can navigate between pages independently. The module tracks the page index using user flags so that players see only the page they have selected. The module is compatible with Foundry VTT **v13**.

The landing page includes additional pages for quick access to your Character Sheet, Inventory and a form to send private notes to the DM.

## Installation

1. Copy the `landing-page` folder into your Foundry VTT `modules` directory.
2. Restart Foundry VTT and enable the module in Game Settings.

## Usage

Upon loading into a world, the landing page will appear automatically. Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to switch pages. The page you select is stored individually and will not affect what other players see.

From the Character Sheet and Inventory pages you can open your actor's sheet directly. The "Notizen an den DM" page lets you send a whispered chat message to all GMs.

The module includes a small CSS file that applies standard Foundry styling to the landing page window.
